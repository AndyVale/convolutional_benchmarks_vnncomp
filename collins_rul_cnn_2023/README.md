# <a href = "https://github.com/loonwerks/vnncomp2022"> Collins Aerospace benchmark problem </a>

Machine Learning (ML) is a disruptive technology for the aviation industry, particularly in safety-critical aircraft functions. In these areas, high-assurance design and verification methods are essential to obtain approval from certification authorities for new ML-based products. Assessing the correctness and robustness of trained models, such as neural networks, is crucial for demonstrating the absence of unintended functionalities. The key motivation for providing this benchmark is to strengthen the interaction between the VNN community and the aerospace industry by offering a realistic use case for neural networks in future avionics systems.
